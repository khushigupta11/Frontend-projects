   <p class="class2">
       So I am not a person who reads a lot of books. Whenever I start reading a book, I just get bored during the initial
       pages and then I feel like closing it again. But I really want to read some of the best books. Then talking about sports,
       I love to play badminton. Bass! Aur kuch khelna nahi aata. I am not so good at cricket, but I love to watch it. I spend a 
       lot of my time watching movies and series. Then speaking of music, everybody likes to listen to music (obviously). Me 
       too! No other option then to listen kyuki kuch bajana bhi yoh nahi aata na. But I want to learn how to play a guitar.
       I learnt how to play a piano but ab sab bhul gayi. I love to listen to all kinds of music.

       I really lilke late night walks and long drives. I love to shop! Who doesn't love shopping? You can ask anytime to go shopping.
       I feel like buying everything, but itni ameer nahi hu. I really like playing cards. Playing cards with my friends , bass I don't
       want anything else. So my favourite movies are Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani , Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and To All The Boys I Have Loved 
       Before! I love to eat. I am a big foodie. I don't know how to cook, bass khana aata hai. Then, I like painting and dancing. Oh!
       I love photography too. I am a really lazy person. I can sleep anytime anywhere. Then my favourite shows are Brooklyn Nine Nine,
       The Office, The Big Bang Theory (TBBT), How I Met Your Mother.
