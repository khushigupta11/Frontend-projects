    <h2 class="class1"> Hey There!<br/></h2>
    <p class="class1"> 
         I am Khushi Gupta an engineering student,who definitely does not know how to expess herself 
        perfectly but having a lot of time in my hands I will try to do so.<br/>So firstly, to give a brief intro about me;
        I am 19 and obsessed with Brooklyn Nine Nine. I am born and brought up here itself in Mumbai, although I would 
        love to live in another part of the world to experience their culture and art.<br/> When you first meet me , I 
        come off really shy and awkward.But according to my friends,I am very loud and dramatic(especially while watching
        some of my favourite shows.)

    <b>The world is a book and those who not travel read only one page.</b><br/><br/>
     So, by this quote above it is clear that I love to travel. I have a lot of things on my bucket list that I would like 
     to strike off. One of my most memeorable trips has to be my trip to Bangkok. That trip helped me strike off para-sailing 
     from my bucket list. It was a great experience and I want to do it again. Oh! I also went to Jammu and Kashmir. It was 
     the most beautiful place I had ever seen. And I also went to Agra. Taj Mahal is so so beautiful. I want to travel new places
     and enjoy every bit of my life. And I think we all should travel and see the beauty of the world.
